# Particles
## Creating Generative Art through Processing using Heart-Rate sensor

This project is an extension of a research paper I had worked on and published in the International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE) in March 2020.

To run this project you will need a pulse sensor, an arduino uno, processing software and arduino softwares installed in your computer.

**Steps:-** 

First, connect the pulse sensor to the arduino and the arduino to the computer. Then upload the 'circuitstoday' code on the arduino and run it. 

Next, run the 'Particles' code on processing. (Make sure the 'Processing' and 'Perlin' code are in the same folder). 

**Softwares**:-
1. [Processing](https://processing.org/)
2. [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
